# VRCapsuleProject

this a project aimed at creating a virtual reality birthday celebration experience for sick children in hospitals who are unable to celebrate their birthday with their family in person. The project simulates mini-games and includes voice chat via Photon, allowing children to interact with their family members and friends in real-time.

## How it works
The project is designed to work with Google Cardboard or any similar virtual reality headset. The user puts on the headset and is transported to a virtual birthday party environment, where they can interact with virtual objects and play mini-games. To simulate vibrations you need Arduino connected to the machine.

The project includes several mini-games that children can play, such as blowing out virtual candles on a birthday cake or playing with virtual balloons. The games are designed to be simple and easy to play, allowing children of all ages to participate.

The project also includes voice chat via Photon, allowing children to communicate with their family members and friends in real-time. This feature is particularly useful for children who are unable to see their loved ones in person due to their illness.

## How to use it
To use the project, you will need a Google Cardboard or similar virtual reality headset. You will also need a computer with Unity installed, Arduino connected to the machine, as well as Python3 to run the server.

To get started, simply clone the repository and open it in Unity. You can then build the project for your desired platform.
Then start the python server notebook script at **\Python script\ConnectToArduino.ipynb**.
Start the game and insert the IP address of the machine running the python server.
You can now play the game!
